map elements
- if touch fire, player moves back 2 spaces and loses 15% of hp
- if touch wall, cannot move past it
- if touch hole, player falls down and loses a life

idea to find object in map
- double for loop to count the indices to find the row and the column
- use == to check if the object in the 2d array is equal to the unique object of the class
- once find true return the row and the column

things left to do
- make start map element and end map element (done)
- add menu to show player info (stats, lives, hp, inventory) (done)
- make 2 rooms
- figure out how to do clear console stuff
- add more things to tell the user stuff (done)



gui stuff
- move play with in the mapelement 2d array and
then have the gui look at it and then change the jlabels accordindly
- find images
